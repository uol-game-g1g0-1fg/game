# Beyond The Shallows

Stranded deep underwater, players are challenged to survive as they travel towards the surface.

## Description
 Beyond The Shallows is a moody “side-scroll” survival game with action/adventure elements.
 The player takes on a journey of underwater exploration, as they attempt to resurface a malfunctioning submarine, amidst encounters with dangerous sea creatures in a hazardous environment.
 The main goal is to reach the surface and the tone becomes gradually lighter as the game progresses.

 This is a project developed as part of the CM3030 Games Development module.
